        <h1>AI in Algorithmic Trading: Where It Helps and Where It Doesn't</h1>

        <p class="lead">I spent 25 years building and selling the infrastructure that financial markets run on. I've seen every hype cycle from the dot-com rush to Y2K to cloud computing to generative AI. Now I build algorithmic trading systems. Here's what I've learned about where AI genuinely belongs in trading, and where it will cost you money.</p>

        <h2>The hype problem</h2>

        <p>Open LinkedIn and you'll find hundreds of posts about "AI-powered trading bots" that promise autonomous wealth generation. Point an AI at the markets, sit back, watch it print money. You know the type.</p>

        <p>I've spent my career on the other side of this. At Sybase, 26 years ago, the majority of the world's equity and FX trades were processed through our databases, I ran the Financial Services and London operation. We built FIX engines and sold them to institutions like Dresdner Kleinwort. We built back-office systems for HSBC. We got banks ready for Y2K (which never materialised, but try telling that to a compliance team in 1999). When the dot-com rush arrived, we built eBusiness capabilities for organisations like Standard Chartered Bank.</p>

        <p>At Sun Microsystems, I ran the global relationship with Thomson Reuters with teams across London, New York and Asia, Reuters technology ran on Sun hardware and software. In the first few weeks of that relationship, the Reuters data centre by the Thames flooded. We arranged total replacement kit without the usual bureaucracy because that's what you do when every second of downtime matters. Relationships in this industry are built on trust, always.</p>

        <p>At Oracle, I led the UK launch of Exadata, the world's first database appliance, selling it directly into financial services and beyond. At Cisco, I managed the Lloyds Banking Group relationship globally, covering networking, security infrastructure and more. Along the way I've introduced concepts like token based two-factor authentication to the UK's largest retail banks, years before anyone outside of security had heard of the term. And yes, there were a few crazy startups in between that didn't quite make it.</p>

        <p>The point isn't the CV. The point is this: the people who actually run money at scale don't think about AI the way LinkedIn tells you they do. The firms that consistently make money use technology with surgical precision. They know exactly where it helps and, just as importantly, where it doesn't.</p>

        <h2>Where AI genuinely helps</h2>

        <p><strong>Research and hypothesis generation.</strong> Markets produce an extraordinary volume of data: price action across timeframes, volatility regimes, correlations between instruments, macroeconomic signals, sentiment shifts. No human can process all of this simultaneously. AI is genuinely exceptional at identifying patterns, validating strategy hypotheses, and synthesising research at a depth and speed that manual analysis simply cannot match.</p>

        <p><strong>Strategy development.</strong> Given a trading concept, say "mean reversion works better in ranging markets than trending ones", AI can help you formalise that into precise rules, identify the conditions under which it holds, and flag the conditions under which it breaks. This is where AI acts as the world's most rigorous research assistant.</p>

        <p><strong>Risk analysis.</strong> Running thousands of simulated scenarios to stress-test a portfolio? Identifying correlation spikes between supposedly independent strategies? Modelling tail-risk events? This is bread and butter for AI. It can process in minutes what would take a human analyst weeks.</p>

        <h2>Where AI is dangerous</h2>

        <p><strong>Live trade execution.</strong> This is the controversial take, but I believe it deeply: AI should not make the final decision on whether to enter or exit a trade. The moment you let a probabilistic system, one that can hallucinate, misinterpret context, or behave unpredictably, control real capital, you've introduced a risk that's almost impossible to quantify.</p>

        <p>Deterministic rules don't hallucinate. If your entry condition is "price above the 50-period moving average AND volatility above a threshold AND no high-impact news in the next 30 minutes," that logic will fire identically every single time. You can audit it. You can explain it. You can trust it at 3am when you're asleep.</p>

        <p>An AI model making the same decision might reach the same conclusion 99% of the time. But that 1%, the edge case, the novel market condition, the subtle distribution shift in the input data, is where fortunes are lost.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p>The best trading systems use AI to build the machine, but the machine itself runs on deterministic rules. The intelligence is in the design, not the execution.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The architecture that works</h2>

        <p>After extensive testing, including one notable failure with an overly complex multi-agent AI system that collapsed under its own administrative overhead (lesson learned the hard way), we arrived at a principle that now governs everything we build:</p>

        <div class="diagram">
            <span class="label-ai">AI RESEARCH</span>
            <br>
            <span class="flow-arrow">&darr;</span>
            <br>
            <span class="label-rules">DETERMINISTIC EXECUTION</span>
            <br>
            <span class="flow-arrow">&darr;</span>
            <br>
            <span class="label-guard">AUTONOMOUS RISK PROTECTION</span>
        </div>

        <p><strong>AI handles research.</strong> It analyses market structure, validates hypotheses, generates trading logic, and helps engineer the systems. This is where its ability to process vast amounts of information creates genuine edge.</p>

        <p><strong>Rules handle execution.</strong> Every live trade follows deterministic logic. Every entry, every exit, every position size can be traced back to a specific, auditable rule. No black boxes in the execution layer.</p>

        <p><strong>Autonomous agents handle protection.</strong> Independent monitoring systems run around the clock, watching portfolio risk metrics and taking protective action if thresholds are breached, without waiting for a human to wake up at 3am. These systems are deliberately simple. They don't need AI. They need reliability.</p>

        <p>Notice the pattern: intelligence decreases as you move closer to real money. The research layer is the most sophisticated. The execution layer is deliberately simple. The safety layer is the simplest of all, and that's by design.</p>

        <h2>The lesson from 25 years in tech</h2>

        <p>I first wrote code in BASIC on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, building games like Space Invaders and Whack-a-Mole from magazine listings (age spoiler, I know). Decades later, I watched from inside the industry as banks adopted every new technology wave. The pattern was always the same: the teams who genuinely understood what the technology could and couldn't do deployed it surgically and gained real advantage. Everyone else chased the hype, over-deployed, and spent years cleaning up the mess.</p>

        <p>I've seen it with client-server, with the internet, with cloud, with mobile, and now with AI. The technology changes but the pattern doesn't. The winners are never the ones with the most sophisticated tools. They're the ones who understand precisely where those tools belong in their stack, and where they don't.</p>

        <p>Build your intelligence into research. Build your execution on rules. Build your safety on simplicity.</p>

        <p>That's what actually works when real money is on the line.</p>
